## 1. HTML Basics

Create a website.html file to contain the website code.

Elements are parts of a web page.

HTML tags are enclosed in <> </>, and are used to create elements.

```<button>``` is the button element, ```<p>``` is the paragraph element, and ```<a>``` is the anchor element, which is used to link to other web pages.

HTML attributes provide additional information about an element.

In a link, the ```href="https://www.youtube.com"``` attribute specifies the URL to link to.

The target attribute specifies whether to open the link in the current page or a new tab.

Attributes are seperated by spaces in the tag.

Extra spaces and newline characters are ignored in HTML files.



## 2. CSS Basics

In this part, we will create three buttons and use CSS to style them.

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and is used to specify how HTML elements appear on screen.

CSS can be added to an HTML file using the <style> tag.

A CSS Selector refers to the name of the element we are styling (ex: button)

A CSS Property refers to the property of the element we are changing (ex: background-color)

The CSS Value is on the right of the property, and is the value we are changing the property to (ex: red)

CSS styles are ended with a semi-colon.

Color values can be displayed using RGB (ex: rgb(200, 0, 0))
