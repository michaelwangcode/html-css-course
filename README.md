## 1. HTML Basics

Create a website.html file to contain the website code.

Elements are parts of a web page.

HTML tags are enclosed in <> </>, and are used to create elements.

```<button>``` is the button element, ```<p>``` is the paragraph element, and ```<a>``` is the anchor element, which is used to link to other web pages.

HTML attributes provide additional information about an element.

In a link, the ```href="https://www.youtube.com"``` attribute specifies the URL to link to.

The target attribute specifies whether to open the link in the current page or a new tab.

Attributes are seperated by spaces in the tag.

Extra spaces and newline characters are ignored in HTML files.
